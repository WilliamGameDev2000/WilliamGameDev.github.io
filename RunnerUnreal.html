                    A hyper casual game

                    Made in 1 day
                </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 127%">
                    I was tasked with making a hyper causal game in Unreal Engine in a day by Mastered bootcamp.
                    Everything from generating ideas to making the game, and so I created a runner game with
                    random generation for the obstacles, a simple time based score system, a reset/fail state,
                    and some environmental objects. Some tweaks to the trampoline object and texturing and the
                    particles were added later as well, and completing the most fundamental game loop for the game.
                    <br />
                    <h2 id="eng">Engine</h2>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Engine used was Unreal v4.27, and the project was set up making use of C++ code and blueprints.
                    The character derived from Unreal's in-built character class setting the properties for movement as
                    well as level reset and collisions. A base class for levels was also created in C++, with functions
                    for binding two triggers that could be called from blueprints. These triggers were bound to two box
                    components to represent spawn and player detection locations in the blueprint which could then be
                    shared with children objects to create a variety of levels to spawn in from an array.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A level spawner and obstacles were created in C++ deriving from Unreal's Actor class as to be placed
                    into the world.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <h2 id="code">Code</h2>
                    <br />
                    The setter code for the level triggers and their spawn locations, to be set through blueprints.
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabRunner1.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    The code for spawning levels when running through the trigger box and despawning levels within the
                    list to manage the level sections loaded in.
                    <span class="image"><img width="1120" src="Images/Code/CodeGrabRunner2.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    This code is to spawn a randomly selected level from the available list as the next segment and place it
                    at the spawn location.
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabRunner3.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    This code defines the collision behaviour on the player as well as the restart function for when the player
                    dies.
