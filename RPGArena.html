                    An Unreal mini RPG game
                </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 127%">
                    On my Mastered bootcamp we had sixteen weeks to produce portfolio pieces, and I took this
                    time to create a demo gameplay loop to show off my systems and importantly how they work
                    together. Below is the blog, screenshots, and code snippets from development on this project.
                    <br />
                    <h2 id="overview">
                        Game Overview
                    </h2>
                    The game is a small scale action RPG set in a gladitorial arena, with an array of classes
                    and races with unique abilities for unique play styles from interesting magical abilities
                    to sword combat and in between. There will be weapons and armour upgrades to buy as you
                    level up and improve your skills, and a variety of people to complete quests for.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/RPGArenaShot2.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    There are a variety of species and classes that are all available from the character creation
                    screen at the beginning of the game, as well as an additional weapon type. You can fully
                    customise the race of the character including classic fantasy races like elves, orcs and
                    goblins, as well as a amphibian like race. Primary weapon types are given based on classes
                    with the standard wizard, warrior, and archer classes and a spearman class, and an additional
                    weapon can be added at the character creation screen or during the game.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/RPGArenaShot3.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    The core of the gameplay loop is to fight through waves of enemies which provide you the
                    XP needed to level up and improve your skills, and chose perks from your classes' skill
                    tree, as well as earn money to spend on equipment in the shop under the arena. Waves of
                    enemies come in several different patterns you can pick from, and randomly generated enemies
                    are created to fit the types specified in the spawn pattern. From this you fight as many waves
                    as you can while leveling up and improving your weapons and armour and increasing your skills.

                        Engine and Development
                    </h2>
                    The game is made in Unreal Engine 4.27 and the characters are all voxel based, and made
                    in MagicaVoxel. This made making simple models with variations to colour quick and much
                    easier than modelling them from scratch while also feeding into the charcter creator section
                    of the game. I also used it to create items/equipment and the obstacles in the world that the
                    player can interact with and stand on.
                    <br />
                    The game also is constructed on a mixture of both Blueprints and C++ code, Unreal's Blueprint
                    system works well for rapid prototyping of systems and visually planning out a feature and is
                    much easier to learn Unreal specific features from. The C++ code is particularly useful in areas
                    that the Blueprints can't handle too well such as calculation functions, which can get messy and
                    working with Blueprints, and for more advanced memory management techniques.

                        Mechanics and Features
                    </h2>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li><h3>Combat</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>Combat has two different attack types based on which weapon is being used.
                           The Axe and Sword items preform melee damage, Bows shoot projectiles, and
                           staves shoot a projectile while also having a melee hitbox as well. Spears
                           were added as well that have a melee range and can also be thrown as a
                           projectile. Players and Enemies can also can wear armour pieces that reduce
                           damage from most damage sources, spells don't follow this principle.
                            <br />
                           Physical projectiles such as arrows from a bow or a thrown spear require a
                           supply of ammunition in your inventory, but can also be retrieved when they
                           land on the ground or can enter an enemies' inventory when hit. Spells will
                           require enough magic in order to cast, and can be recovered by potions or
                            waiting.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                           Starting weapons are determined by class as well as a free choice of your
                           bonus weapon, and further equipment such as new weapons and armour can be
                           found in loot dropped by enemies. Health and Magic regenerate over time as
                           well when under certain conditions and can be boosted by potions and some
                           ingredients. The player has two active slots for all their weapons, which
                           can be freely swapped between, and four slots for each armour piece.
                            <br />
                            Killing enemies earns the player extra gold and XP to acquire extra equipment
                            from the shops, and also has a chance of dropping a temporary chest that 
                            player look through to pick up items for their own inventory.

                                Shops have their own inventory system that you can peek into on each shop keeper
                                and an additional tab to look at your own inventory. There is also a quantity
                                slider and a buy/sell button allow for a transaction between the player and shop
                                keeper.

                            Using a gold currency the player can buy equipment or sell equipment to earn more in
                            order to purchaes new items such as additional ammo for their bow or useful potions or
                            armour. Tiers and upgraded pieces of armour and weaponry are also planned to be made
                            available.

                        <p>
                            The inventory system is a collection of slots that store data from items which for each
                            instance of the component on an object can be completely customisable with the amount of
                            space it contains and where the UI anchors to etc.
                            <br />
                            <span class="image"><img src="Images/RPGArenaInventoryEditor.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                            <br />
                            The inventory can be prepoulated fairly easily and can easily be given a randomiser function
                            for additional functionality. Since inventories populated by enemy loot drops work on a chance
                            to contain the item system something similiar can be done picking from the pool of items or
                            picking items from a tier.

                    </h2>
                    A behaviour tree that controls which states the enemy AI are in, their patrolling state or
                    their target states, and to attack once in range:
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/RPGArenaCode1.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    Damange calculations based on the factors such as weapon used, the skills of the character
                    using it, the armour equipped on the target which can dynamically change through other systems
                    that the player engages with:
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/RPGArenaCode2.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    These systems include the level up system which updates the player's stats when enough XP has
                    been accumulated, the modular armour and weapon equipment system which changes what and how many
                    pieces of armour and weapons the player has currently equipped. <br />
                    In addition there is a minimal damage check to prevent erronious calculations from making it through
                    to the damage applied.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I used C++ to handle the stat calculation systems, in a completely class independant method which
                    allows for it to be made applicable to enemies and allies in addition to the player.
