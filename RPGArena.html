                    An Unreal mini RPG game
                </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 127%">
                    On my Mastered bootcamp we had sixteen weeks to produce portfolio pieces, and I took the
                    time to create a full gameplay loop to show off my systems and importantly how they work
                    together. Below is the blog, screenshots, and code snippets from development on this project.
                    <br />
                    <h2 id="overview">
                        Game Overview
                    </h2>
                    The game is a small scale action RPG set in a gladitorial arena, with an array of classes
                    and races with unique abilities for unique play styles from interesting magical abilities
                    to sword combat and in between. There will be weapons and armour upgrades to buy as you
                    level up and improve your skills, and a variety of people to complete quests for.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/RPGArenaShot2.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    There are a variety of species and classes that are all available from the character creation
                    screen at the beginning of the game, as well as an additional weapon type.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/RPGArenaShot3.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    The core of the gameplay loop is to fight through waves of enemies which provide you the
                    XP needed to level up and improve your skills, and chose perks from your classes' skill
                    tree, as well as earn money to spend on equipment in the shop under the arena. Waves of
                    enemies come in several different patterns you can pick from, and randomly generated enemies
                    are created to fit the types specified in the spawn pattern. From this you fight as many waves
                    as you can while leveling up and improving your weapons and armour and increasing your skills.

                        Engine and Development
                    </h2>
                    The game is made in Unreal Engine 4.27 and the characters are all voxel based, and made
                    in MagicaVoxel. This made making simple models with variations to colour quick and much
                    easier than modelling them from scratch while also feeding into the charcter creator section
                    of the game. I also used it to create items/equipment and the obstacles in the world that the
                    player can interact with and stand on.
                    <br />
                    The game also is constructed on a mixture of both Blueprints and C++ code,
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h2 id="code">

                    </h2>
                    A behaviour tree that controls which states the enemy AI are in, their patrolling state or
                    their target states, and to attack once in range:
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/RPGArenaCode1.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    Damange calculations based on the factors such as weapon used, the skills of the character
                    using it, the armour equipped on the target which can dynamically change through other systems
                    that the player engages with:
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/RPGArenaCode2.png" alt="" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    These systems include the level up system which updates the player's stats when enough XP has
                    been accumulated, the modular armour and weapon equipment system which changes what and how many
                    pieces of armour and weapons the player has currently equipped. <br />
                    In addition there is a minimal damage check to prevent erronious calculations from making it through
                    to the damage applied.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I used C++ to handle the stat calculation systems, in a completely class independant method which
                    allows for it to be made applicable to enemies and allies in addition to the player.
