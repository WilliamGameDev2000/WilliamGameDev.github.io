                    Catpitalism is a story about David the cat trying to climb his way up the corporate
                    ladder in an oppressive office full of...Mice! Fight your way through office floors,
                    break rooms, and more (coming later) while taking on your managers and bosses until
                    you reach the top.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    There are a few weapons to chose from including environmental objects that can be
                    picked up and thrown at enemies and bosses. There is currently a basic enemy type
                    that closes in on the player (a bit like how the VampireSurvivors gameplay loop
                    is), as well as a boss unit that has special attack patterns and projectiles.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After the submission I have also been tweaking and updating features (such as 
                    adding in the throwable objects) as well as polishing features to account for
                    edgecasing and making systems more generic to help in further development.

                    <br />
                    The game was made in Godot, using the in-built GDScript language which has several
                    commonalities with Python such as forced indentation. It was a first time using
                    GDScript for me however I was able to work it out and contribute key aspects such
                    as the player movement system and help others with their systems as well.
                    <br />
                    I also helped out by taking advantage of some of Godot's in-built functionality
                    to help other team members with their development like finding the way to add
                    collision to the tile-maps intrinsically for the level designers. I also helped
                    in debugging and troubleshooting systems during their development and after
                    merge conflicts with the Git repo.
