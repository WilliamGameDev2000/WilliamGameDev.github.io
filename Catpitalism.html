                    Catpitalism is a story about David the cat trying to climb his way up the corporate
                    ladder in an oppressive office full of...Mice! Fight your way through office floors,
                    break rooms, and more (coming later) while taking on your managers and bosses until
                    you reach the top.

                    There are a few weapons to chose from including environmental objects that can be
                    picked up and thrown at enemies and bosses. There is currently a basic enemy type
                    that closes in on the player (a bit like how the VampireSurvivors gameplay loop
                    is), as well as a boss unit that has special attack patterns and projectiles.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After the submission I have also been tweaking and updating features (such as
                    adding in the throwable objects and creating the temporary player UI) as well
                    as polishing features to account for edgecasing and making systems more generic
                    to help in further development.

                    <h2 id="Dev">Development & Engine</h2>
                    <br />
                    The game was made in Godot, using the in-built GDScript language which has several
                    commonalities with Python such as forced indentation. It was a first time using
                    GDScript for me however I was able to work it out and contribute key aspects such
                    as the player movement system and help others with their systems as well. It was
                    not, however, my first time using the Godot engine and it's interface and I was
                    confident in navigation the engine and it's features and utilising them.
                    <br />
                    I also helped out by taking advantage of some of Godot's in-built functionality
                    to help other team members with their development like finding the way to add
                    collision to the tile-maps themselves for the level designers without needing to
                    create a collision around the whole level piece by piece. I also helped out in
                    debugging and troubleshooting systems during their development and after merge
                    conflicts with the Git repo.

                    <br />
                    - WASD & arrow keys are movement, and SPACE performs a semi invunerable
                    combat roll for avoiding projectiles. Movement is snappy and responsive,
                    rather than slippery while still being momentum based.

                    - LMB shoots projectiles from the bullet pool and throws a held object
                    towards the mouse location. These both apply damage to any enemies they
                    collide with.

                    - E key picks up throwable objects when in range, they'll tint shift a
                    light blue colour to indicate they can be held. This puts the player in
                    an altered state where they slow down their movement speed and have to
                    throw the object again before being able to fire their weapon again.
                    Also interacts with certain environmental features such as containers
                    that drop healing items before going on a short cool down.

                    - Weapon swapping can be done at any weapon pick-up (Currently a place
                    holder orb sprite) and will automatically change the player's weapon
                    to the corrosponding weapon on the pick up object. Weapons can be
                    set up with unique attributes such as their projectile's damage
                    values, how much durability they have etc.

                    - Healing fills up your current health bar if you're not at max for
                    the current life. The player has nine lives that they can take three
                    points of damage on each before not being able to heal to the next life
                    up again. Healing is done by picking up David's favourite food item - a
                    sandwich.
                    <h2 id="code">Code & examples</h2>
                    Code grabs of the player script I created <br />
                    [
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabDavid1.png" alt="" class="preset-file"/></span>
                    <br />

                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabDavid3.png" alt="" class="preset-file"/></span>
                    <br />
                    ] <br />
                    The code is a simple responsive movement system making use of Godot's 2D Vector
                    features, with a fairly simple dash mechanic with a few i-frames for collisions
                    and a reference to a point on the player object that checks for and holds throwable
                    weapons. This weapon and if it's filled is checked and the weight valuable is taken
                    into consideration for the movement speed as well.
