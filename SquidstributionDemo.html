                        Development and Engine Choice
                    </h2>
                    The Squidstribution demo project was built using Unity Game Engine v2021.1.21f and the version control was managed with Github
                    to manage the additional contributions made by all team members. The project has started out as a university submission project,
                    and has since been expanded within the level and the systems present in our submission piece. We made use of some Unity packages
                    during development including: shader graph for URP shaders, as well as probuilder for prototyping some of the building designs
                    and destruction effects, and the Low Poly City pack by Synty for some environmental assets and cars. Navigation for the player
                    and NPC movement was handled through the in-built unity Navmesh, but an additional AI package from Unity's Github page allowed
                    for NavSurface definitions and for more control over definitions for agent type behaviours on certain areas. For our scripts
                    we also used the IDamagable interface to make applying damage much easier to objects that extend this behaviour.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Models and associated rubble pieces on custom buildings all were made in Blender, with use from the cell fracture effect,
                    and separated into prefabs in Unity that are swapped out for each other when the buildings are destroyed. This combined with
                    physics affecting the pieces meant that the destruction was varied each time the buildings were destroyed, to help keep game
                    visuals fresher and more engaging. We also installed Cinemachine to smooth camera transitions and work on cutscenes.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/SquidGameShot3.png" alt="camera swap" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    We also used tricks such as swapping between cameras with different UI elements and fiters to try and create different feelings
                    based on certain events that happen in game, for instance the above picture shows how certain points in the game will transition
                    to a news camera to help sell that this is a giant monster and create the desired atmosphere when playing the game. The increase
                    distance also helps to make him feel more dangerous. The ticker text running along the news report also pulls from a set of
                    text lines which can help add some variety to the visuals when experiencing this change in camera.

                        Game Overview
                    </h2>
                    The game sees you controlling the kaiju squid washed up on land in squid city, and from there you must contol him in order
                    to restore the feng shui to restore the karma in the city. These karma points can be spent to create minions in your quest
                    to destroy all the bad buildings and to use special moves for massive damage! The more and more karma you build up the larger
                    and more powerful you grow, but the bigger your threat level becomes the more enemies will come for you.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/SquidGameShot2.png" width="720" alt="size comparison" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    Enemies chase you down from military bases for as long as they stand, and wherever you go! While the enemies are still alive
                    they will navigate to find you anywhere in the city, and they will even try to find you across the water if they can fly. It's
                    a good idea to destroy their bases first to try and stop them spawning, as the more you progress the more difficult it will be
                    to take them on in order to help create a level curve.

                        The Team
                    </h2>
                    As a group we all believe the demo is a solid proof of concept that can be worked on, and that the game has a clear
                    vision of how we can progress. We designed the game to the brief, that came from a random idea generated from a seed,
                    of a god game where you distribute squids however we didn't limit ourselves to considering other aspects of the game
                    such as the destruction aspects. As a group we also had to consider the motiviations players have when going into a
                    game as part of the assignment, which led to the creation of a custom achievment even system for completing certain
                    actions during the gameplay.

                    The team was made up of: <a href="https://github.com/charlie2099" target="_blank">Charlie Evans</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Ahillman2000" target="_blank">Alexander Hillman</a>,
                    <a href="https://github.com/AlexTheMeh" target="_blank">Alexander Long</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/SeriTheButterfly" target="_blank">Stephanie Chan</a>

                        My Contributions
                    </h2>

                    In particular I worked on a variety of the game sysetms, the game design, and the art-side of the project. The score calculation
                    system when destroying buildings and killing enemies was done by me and then expanded with our custom event system.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid1.png" width="720" alt="scoring calculations" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    The building destruction code was done by me and another team mate with further additions such as special composite building types
                    and buildings that can't be destroyed until certain conditions are met etc were added by me. Below is the standard destruction script
                    for buildings:
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid12.png" width="720" alt="damage buildings" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    Applies damage to this object.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid13.png" width="900" alt="call on deactivation" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    Gets the correct prefab for the rubble pieces, adds physics to them, and calls on the deactivation of the pieces on a timer.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid14.png" width="720" alt="deactivation event" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    It then alerts the event manager upon deactivation.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I also worked on the player input and movement systems that make use of the navmesh objects and moves the player towards the point,
                    clicked based on the screen position. The system works as the certain places are marked as ground using layers and so additional
                    input functionality such as the unit selection can be achieved using additional layers which also have modified conditions to add
                    more functionality to mouse input. The logic for the unit control and their input system was also implemented by me.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid9.png" width="720" alt="Select script 1" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid10.png" width="720" alt="Select script 2" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Additional player input logic for the special abilities that deal extra damage and make us of the karma point system was added and
                    then further optimised and improved by me. The special attack systems was changed to be event based, and uses a inheritance Object
                    Orientated Programming principle to derive different abilities as child classes, which helps it to be expandable. As each ability
                    is a component on the player as well this should in theory make setting up a system for swapping abilities modular out in a load
                    out fairly feasible and is something I hope to do in the future.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid2.png" width="720" alt="ability trigger code" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid3.png" width="720" alt="ability logic code 1" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid4.png" width="720" alt="ability logic code 2" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid5.png" width="720" alt="ability logic code 3" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid7.png" width="720" alt="ability logic code 4" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    I made some updates to the UI, such as adding in several more bars to communicate information to the player quickly such and also
                    creating the sprite work for them, as well as writing a bar fill script which manages how much to fill each bar.
                    <br />
                    Furhter more I worked on some simple environemntal scripts to help with balancing and making the city itself more interactive, such
                    as the healing script that attaches to floor pieces in water sections. There is also a desctruction script which allows parts of the
                    city that aren't buildings to also be destroyed, with out the need for the additional component dependacies that buildings need.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid7.png" width="720" alt="ability logic code 4" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    I worked on creating the visuals and upgrading them since the submission date as well, teaching myself about shaders in unity and
                    controlling variables on the shader through code as well which I set up this dissolve shader to remove game objects from the scene
                    smoothly.
                    <br />
                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid11.png" width="720" alt="shader graph dissolve" class="preset-file" /></span>

                    <span class="image"><img src="Images/Code/CodeGrabSquid8.png" width="720" alt="dissolve implementation" class="preset-file" /></span>
                    <br />
                    There is also the newest designs that I have been working on, for the boss encounter ending the level by working on both the modelling
                    and materials, and the game design documentation for the boss and how it should be implemented. I also worked on setting up cutscenes
                    within the game through cinemachine.
